# Development Log

I'll try my best to write down everything (or key moments) as I go.

- Initial Repo
- Using LibGDX Java Library

### üí° Idea So Far
"Based on the 12 animals in the Chinese Zodiac, Candle Dog has to warn the other animals before LED Dragon takes over the kingdom."

- Similar to the early Pokemon Games, and inspired by the fruits in One Piece
- Tile-based map, battle cutscenes when approached by enemies
- The player can change the name of their Candle Dog at the start of the game (I'll just call him Dog throughout this log)

The kingdom is split into 12 Cities. The animals were born with elemental powers and to control order, each city has appointed a Mayor that is their  strongest. The main character Candle Dog was born with a candle for a tail. Candle Dog wanted to bring light into the world with his tail but has been mocked by society-- even in Dog City. Dog fled to Goat City, the most peaceful city in the kingdom. 

Candle Dog later found out that the Dragon King, the most powerful creature in the kingdom, wasn't even born with any elemental powers but is still somehow that powerful. Usually Dragons are born with Fire but this guy doesn't... Candle Dog goes on an adventure to investigate.

The Twelve Cities that the dog will encounter are in this order:

| **City Name**       | **Animal** | **Ruled by** | **Main Element** |
|---------------------|------------|--------------|------------------|
| 1. Mount Bundok     | Goat       | Isa          | Ice              |
| 2. Buhay Village    | Rabbit     | Dalawa       | Grass            |
| 3. Bato Village     | Rat        | Tatlo        | Rock             |
| 4. Lipad Town       | Pig        | Apat         | Wind / Air       |
| 5. Apoy Town        | Dog        | Lima         | Fire             |
| 6. Tanso City       | Rooster    | Anim         | Metal            |
| 7. Yente City       | Monkey     | Pito         | Electricity      |
| 8. Lason City       | Snake      | Walo         | Poison / Dark    |
| 9. Mundo Capital    | Ox         | Siyam        | Earth            |
| 10. Liwanag Capital | Horse      | Sampu        | Light / Holy     |
| 11. Laban Capital   | Tiger      | Manny        | Dark / Fighting  |
| 12. Dahas Country   | Dragon     | Drake        | Fire             |

The city names are named after the elements that they are ruled by, translated to Tagalog.
The ruler names are Tagalog numbers, in order. 

The Tiger Mayor is named Manny because Manny Pacquiao is a famous Filipino boxer.
The Dragon King is named Drake because I don't think there's a Tagalog word for Dragon.

Each citizen will either be on the lookout to stop Candle Dog, or trying to help.
